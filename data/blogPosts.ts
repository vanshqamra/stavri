    content: `## Understand the lifestyle brief\n\nLuxury villas demand materials that pair prestige with performance. Begin with the client's desired palette and maintenance expectations. White stones such as **Makrana White** or **Statuario** deliver light-filled interiors, while darker statements like **Portoro Black** anchor club lounges.\n\n### Consider usage intensity\n- For high-traffic foyers, specify denser stones (Crema Marfil, Pietra Grey).\n- For spa-like bathrooms, prioritize low porosity and slip-resistant finishes.\n- For outdoor verandas, combine honed finishes with proper sealing.\n\n### Plan the supply chain\nRab Noor Pvt Ltd coordinates quarry blocking in India and Europe, ensures ISPM 15 packaging, and books the optimal sailing to your project port.`

    content: `## Marble for bespoke luxury\nMarble offers unmatched veining and polish, perfect for kitchens with attentive care. Specify sealants and educate clients about patina.\n\n## Granite for rugged use\nBlack Galaxy and other dense stones resist staining and heat, ideal for family kitchens and outdoor bars.\n\n## Quartz for uniformity\nWhen color consistency and low maintenance are paramount, engineered quartz works well, but it cannot replicate the prestige of authentic marble. Rab Noor Pvt Ltd helps clients mix materials based on zone-by-zone requirements.`
